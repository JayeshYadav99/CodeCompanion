## ‚öô What it does -
Code Companion is a website that provides a variety of tools and features for software developers. It aims to make coding more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. With features such as a code comment adder, space and time complexity and space complexity analyzer, code explainer, and error finder, Code Companion offers a comprehensive solution for software development needs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Code Companion can help you write better code, understand your code's performance, and resolve errors. With its user-friendly interface and easy-to-use tools, Code Companion is the perfect companion for all your coding needs.

## üîß How we built it-
Code Companion utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The website is built using Node.js and Express.js, which allows for efficient and scalable server-side operations. Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive design and ensure that the website looks great on any device. Finally, OpenAI technologies, such as advanced algorithms and data structures, are used to provide accurate and efficient results for the various tools and features offered by Code Companion, such as the space and time complexity analyzer and the error finder.

## üí™ Challenges we ran into -
Designing a user-friendly and accessible interface that appeals to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced developers was a great task, we were new to API's so working with them was bit tricky and we also faced problems when integrated frontend tools like tailwind to backend tools like node js.


## üìå Accomplishments that we're proud of -
Creating a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that makes coding more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for developers of all skill levels.

Implementing advanced algorithms and data structures to provide accurate and efficient results for the various tools and features offered by the website.

## üìö What we learned -
We learned use of API's, tailwind css and how to integrate services like OPENAI in our project.

## ‚è≠ What's next for -
We want to integrate compiler for various languages like Java, C++,C , python and etc. 2.Adding new features and tools to further improve the coding experience, such as code auto-completion, code suggestion, and code optimization.
